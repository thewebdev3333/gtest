            <h3 className="text-md font-medium mt-4">2.1 Market Risk</h3>
            <p className="text-sm text-muted-foreground">
              Synthetic indices prices are influenced by a variety of factors, including market sentiment, economic conditions, and volatility. Prices can move rapidly and unpredictably, resulting in significant losses.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-md font-medium mt-4">2.2 Leverage Risk</h3>
            <p className="text-sm text-muted-foreground">
              Our platform offers leveraged trading, which amplifies both potential profits and potential losses. Even small market movements can result in substantial losses that may exceed your initial investment.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-md font-medium mt-4">2.3 Liquidity Risk</h3>
            <p className="text-sm text-muted-foreground">
              In certain market conditions, it may be difficult to enter or exit positions at desired prices. This can result in slippage and unexpected losses.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-md font-medium mt-4">2.4 Technology Risk</h3>
            <p className="text-sm text-muted-foreground">
              Our platform relies on internet connectivity and technology infrastructure. Disruptions, delays, or technical failures may affect your ability to trade and could result in financial losses.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-md font-medium mt-4">2.5 Counterparty Risk</h3>
            <p className="text-sm text-muted-foreground">
              We act as the counterparty to all trades. While we maintain robust financial controls, there is a risk of default or financial failure.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-md font-medium mt-4">2.6 Regulatory Risk</h3>

              <li>
                <strong>Understand the products you are trading.</strong> Before trading any synthetic index, ensure you fully understand how it works and the factors that affect its price.
